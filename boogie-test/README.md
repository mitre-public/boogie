# Boogie Test

# Module overview

Integration testing module for Boogie. Most of the sub-modules are independent from a dependency perspective but are meant to be usable synergistically - this exists as a place to see how that interop works.
The tests in this class rely on an embedded cycle of navigation data from CIFP which is used to build a more holistic testing suite.
